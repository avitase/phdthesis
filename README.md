  ## Abstract
  A search for the rare two-body decays Λb → D°Λ and Ξb° → D°Λ is performed with proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1/(6 fb), collected by the LHCb experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The decay Λb → D°Λ is seen with a statistical significance of 5.5 standard deviations, and constitutes the discovery for this decay.

  The branching fraction, measured using the Λb → D°pπ decay for normalization, is 
  (Λb → D°Λ) = (9.9 ± 2.3 ± 1.6 ± 1.1) x 1e-6, where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and external, respectively.
  An excess of Ξb° → D°Λ candidates w.r.t. the background is observed with a statistical significance of 1.8 standard deviations and is used to estimate the upper limit f(Ξb°) / f(Λb) x B(Ξb° → D°Λ) / f(Λb → D°Λ) < 0.5 (CL = 95%), where f(Ξb°) / f(Λb) is the ratio of the fragmentation fractions of b-quarks into Ξb° and Λb baryons.
